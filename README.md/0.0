# SpiritCrew
A Wurm server side mod for Ago's launcher wich add a spell to bind spirits to boats to speed them up (also a shameless ripoff of BagOfHolding by Ago)

"Oooh man ... Daa boat is too slow! Let's get some ancestors to help and row."

This mod is aimed at soloers ans small population servers. It adds a spell named spiritcrew to every religion.
This spell can be cast on boats to add an enchant ( I used the id for opulence as i dont think we will be able to eat ships soon).
The enchant virtually fills passengers seats the same way rare ships does codewise (1 seat per 10 power of enchantment).

To achive this, I modified the method calculateNewBoatSpeed wich is called in Creature.sendData. Probably not a good thing.
It is also called in Player.disembark but I think it is way less problematic.

First attempt at coding since almost 10 years.
